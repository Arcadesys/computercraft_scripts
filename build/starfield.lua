--generates an artifical starfield of given density in the sky (at least 15-60 blocks above ground)
-- starfield can be made of shroomlights, glass, glowstone, or any other block
-- does not destroy blocks it encounters
-- will always try to place stars at least two blocks away from obstacles
-- the resulting starfield should resemble an artifical night sky
