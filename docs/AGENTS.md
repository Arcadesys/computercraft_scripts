PURPOSE
This is a set of computercraft scripts for Valhelsia 6. I want to create turtles to handle most, if not all, of my work in game. You are going to help me create a lua script for each of the below todos.

your code should be well documented, with human readable variable names and comments. I am not skilled in lua, so you also give me tips on lua.

## Build Process

This project uses a build system to bundle the Lua scripts. After making any changes to the source files, you must run the build script to apply the changes.

Run the following command in the terminal:

`node build/bundle.js`

Ensure that all changes are captured by the buildloader to be considered 'done'.
