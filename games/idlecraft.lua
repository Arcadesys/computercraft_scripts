💾 IdleCraft: Number Go Up
You are “The Player.”
Your mission: industrialize fun.

🪓 Stage 1 – Manual Labor
Button mapping (initially):


Left: Mine block (+1 Cobble)


Middle: Craft tools (spend Cobble to increase efficiency)


Right: Hire Steve (costs Cobble, adds passive income)


Flavor text:

“You punch a tree. It feels nostalgic.”
“Your first Steve joins. He mines when you’re not looking.”

Resources:


Cobble (primary currency)


Steves (workers; 1 Cobble/sec each)



⛏️ Stage 2 – Mod Madness
Once you hit, say, 100 Steves or 1,000 Cobble:


Unlock Mods — they bring automation.


Now “Mods” generate Cobble faster, but sometimes break stuff.


Event examples:

“A mod adds an extra furnace recipe. +20% efficiency!”
“Forge update broke your world. -10 Steves.”

Upgrades start to feel like managing chaos.
Mods are powerful, but unstable.

⚙️ Stage 3 – Industrialization
Introduce Digital Miners (from Mekanism or similar tech mods).
Each upgrade represents a paradigm shift in resource production:


Manual → Workers → Machines → Scripts → Console Commands.


Here, you start gaining ORES PER TICK.
You’re no longer a player. You’re the algorithm.

💻 Stage 4 – The Great Automation
Now you unlock Computercraft.
This is the stage where you can literally automate the game from inside the game.
Each “Computercraft” upgrade could spawn another turtle or add a new script that multiplies your income.
Flavor text:

“You taught a turtle to mine. It never complains.”
“A small screen flickers: ‘while true do numberGoUp() end’”

From here, exponential growth kicks in.
OPS (ores per second) becomes OES (ores per exponential second).

🪙 Stage 5 – /GIVE Ascension
The final layer — you achieve creative-mode apotheosis.
Upgrades now cost absurd amounts, but reward you with the power of admin commands.
Possible upgrades:


/time set day → doubles output


/tp Steves → instant delivery


/fill → rebuilds your factory instantly


/give @p netherite_block 64 → prestige level


Endgame text:

“You gaze upon your empire. Steves worship your UUID. The console whispers: ‘/op achieved.’”

🧩 Next Steps
If you want, I can code the first two stages — manual mining and Steves — into a working CC:Tweaked Lua file, with the number-go-up loop, upgrades, and random flavor events built in. Then we can layer Mods, Miners, and Computercraft automation on top in later versions like actual patch notes.
Would you like me to write that base script next — “IdleCraft v0.1: The Steve Update”?
